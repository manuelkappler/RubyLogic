### Introduction

Whereas in sentential logic, we took sentences as basic, in predicate logic we are also interested in the *internal structure* of sentences. Specifically, we now separate **Predicates**, which correspond to *properties of things* or *relations between things*, and **Terms**, which are either *constants* (referring directly to things) or *variables* (ranging over a variety of things).
